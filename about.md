Since we arrived in Canada, we watched our community grow in North York & sensed a need for a place of ours.

In 2014, we **Roots of Change Community Centre** became a registered non-profit organization.

We are gathering funds to realize this dream of having: A multi-purpose facility including a Quran Center, a place where our children will learn their language & get in touch with their culture.

Finally, it is also a place for our community to get to know each other & celebrate events!

### Sincere thanks for your support,
Rania Elfarouki
Organization Director
